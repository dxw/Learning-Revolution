"The Victorian Way of Death","Death was ever present in nineteenth century life. Not as morbid as it may sound, cultural historian Danny Wells gives us a fascinating glimpse into Victorian attitudes to death.
This talk is a part of Walsall Museum's regular programme of free public talks on local history, family history and social history.  Places are limited so advance booking is essential.",,,27/10/09 14:00,27/10/09 15:00,,"Heritage and History","Demonstration",,"Jennifer Thomson","museum@walsall.gov.uk","01922 653116","Walsall Museum",TRUE,,,,,,,"WS1 1TR",,
