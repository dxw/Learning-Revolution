<h3>1. What is the Learning Revolution? </h3>
<p>The Learning Revolution aims to open up more opportunities for people of all ages to learn for pleasure and raise awareness of the mental and physical benefits that continuing to learn brings people.</p>
<p>It embraces the whole spectrum of informal adult learning – learning from websites like Wikipedia, art classes, book clubs, car maintenance, rambling, singing and dancing.</p>

<h3>2. What is informal adult learning?</h3>
<p>Informal adult learning is non-accredited learning for pleasure, development and fulfilment. It can be a stepping stone to further learning, qualifications and more rewarding work. It can help keep people mentally and physically active and independent into old age. It can bring people and communities together.</p>

<h3>3. Why get involved with the Learning Revolution?</h3>
<p>By coming together with other organisations under the banner of The Learning Revolution, you’ll help lifelong learning gain a higher profile and greater influence with the public and private sectors going forward – helping organisations and people like you to find more resources and make contact with more learners.</p>

<h3>4. Who is The Learning Revolution aimed at?</h3>
<p>We want to involve individuals and their communities who are currently or could be learning for pleasure, across all ages and from all backgrounds. We particularly want to encourage those who may not see themselves as potential learners, for whatever reason. Our aim is to inspire people to take part in all types of activities related to learning for pleasure, both structured and self-organised. By continuing to learn, they will build new skills and knowledge, discover new hobbies and interests, and share their passions with others like them.</p>

<h3>5. What is the Learning Revolution Festival? </h3>
<p>We all like to learn new things, go to new places and meet new people. The Learning Revolution Festival celebrates all kinds of informal adult learning and the difference learning makes to individuals, families, communities and organisations.</p>
<p>Throughout October, hundreds of events will highlight the wide variety of learning that’s taking place. The month will give people who are already taking part in informal learning a chance to celebrate what they enjoy and will give others the opportunity to try something new.</p>
<p>Libraries, galleries, adult education providers, sports clubs, voluntary organisations, self-organised groups and many other organisations can get involved by showcasing activities that are already available and offering, or signposting, new activities to get people started.</p>
