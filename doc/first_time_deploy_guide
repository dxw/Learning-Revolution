In Git:

$ git checkout master
$ git branch -f production
$ git push origin production

This brings production up-to-date with the master branch.

On production:

$ cd code/Learning-Revolution                          # a checkout of the code
$ git pull
$ ln -s ~/default/current/config/database.yml config/  # if it isn't already there
$ RAILS_ENV=production rake db:reset
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/import lib/tasks/clean_data/*

This ensures you a. don't see a big 500 when you deploy, and b. have some data.

On your machine:

$ cap production deploy

Type in the appropriate passwords.

Production should now be live.
